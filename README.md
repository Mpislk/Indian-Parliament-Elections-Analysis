This project is done as part of CodeBasics Resume Challenge Project 11.
The aim of the project is to analyse the data and present insights from the data on Indian Parliamentary Elections of 2014 and 2019.
The dataset comprises of constituency wise results of 2014 and 2019 elections which contain information like state, pc (parliamentary constituency) and number of electors in that pc, list of participating candidates, their age, category, respresenting party, gender and votes secured. The total votes secured are aggregate sum of general votes and postal votes. 
There are some inconsistencies in data and the raw data is cleaned using python and the cleaned data is stored in .csv format.
