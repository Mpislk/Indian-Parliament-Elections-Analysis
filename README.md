This project is done as part of CodeBasics Resume Challenge Project 11. 
The aim of the project is to analyse the data and present insights from the data on Indian Parliamentary Elections of 2014 and 2019. 
The dataset comprises of constituency wise results of 2014 and 2019 elections which contain information like state, pc (parliamentary constituency) and number of electors in that pc, list of participating candidates, their age, category, respresenting party, gender and votes secured. The total votes secured are aggregate sum of general votes and postal votes.
First, the data of 2014 elections and 2019 elections are induvidually analysed.
Parameters like Electoral roll (Total number of Electors in pc) , Voter Turnout Ratio (Electors voted/ Electoral Roll) are calculated across constituencies and states. The demographic parameters like Area, Population, Gender Ratio, Winning party of top and bottom areas of these parameters is analysed and insights are noted.
Also, the party wise distribution of votes at national and state levels are observed. 
Then, comparative analysis of 2014 and 2019 elections in terms of changes in vote share of parties etc are analysed.
The notable observations are 1) the reluctance among educated urban constituencies like New Delhi, Hyderabad etc reflected by their bottom position in poor voter turnout ratio relative to others, 2) correlation between largely populated states and poor voter turnout ratio (in UP, Maharastra). 
Code related to the analysis can be seen in the ipynb file attached and the analysis and stats are available in the presentation attached.
